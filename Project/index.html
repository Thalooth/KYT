        <h1>Brain Tumor and its grades</h1>
        <p>A brain tumor is a collection, or mass, of abnormal cells in your brain. Your skull, which encloses your brain, is very rigid. Any growth inside such a restricted space can cause problems. Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). When benign or malignant tumors grow, they can cause the pressure inside your skull to increase. This can cause brain damage, and it can be life-threatening.</p>
        <p>A staging system is used for most other types of tumors in other parts of the body, to describe where a tumor is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body. However, there is no recommended systemic staging system for adult brain tumors because most primary tumors do not usually spread beyond the central nervous system. The grading system described below is always used instead because the specific features of a brain tumor determine how cancerous it is and how likely it is to grow.</p>
        <p>The grade is determined by its features, as seen under a microscope, according to the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Grade I. These tumors are slow growing and unlikely to spread. They can often be cured with surgery.</li>
        	<li>Grade II. These tumors are less likely to grow and spread but are more likely to come back after treatment.</li>
        	<li>Grade III. These tumors are more likely to have rapidly dividing cells but no dead cells. They can grow quickly.</li>
        	<li>Grade IV. In a grade IV tumor, cells in the tumor are actively dividing. In addition, the tumor has blood vessel growth and areas of dead tissue. These tumors can grow and spread quickly.</li>
        </ul>
